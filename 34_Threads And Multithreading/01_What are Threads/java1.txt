- When you run an application, the software that you have written will be running on an OS( Operating System).
- Below the OS, a layer is present that is known as Hardware.
- Software will always run on hardware.
- Hardware consists of:
 RAM - acts as a temporary memory for processing
 CPU - that executes something (processing done here)
- OS supports multiple software working at the same time and it means it supports Multitasking.
- Multitasking:
Multitasking is the ability of the CPU to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. There will be continuous context switching of the CPU between the tasks.
- CPU has a concept of time sharing which means each process runs for some short period of time one by one. The software runs parallelly by sharing the time in the CPU.

- We can also divide our tasks into small units.
- In the same task or a program, we can have multiple threads running at the same time.
- Thread is light-weight and it is the smallest unit of a task. 
- Multithreading:-
Multithreading is a system in which many threads are created from a process through which the computer power is increased.
