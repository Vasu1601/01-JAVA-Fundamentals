in previous lecture we had discussed what is polymorphism 
-- in this lecture we are further talking about run time polymorphism
-- suppose we have some class A , B and C
-- class B and C extends A 
-- in All three class we have show() method 
-- main() method of Demo we create object of A, B and C but we create only reference of A which can hold
object of A, B and C .
class A{
public void show(){
    Systeem.out.println("in show A");
}
}
class B extends A{
public void show(){
    Systeem.out.println("in show B");
}
}

class C extends A{
public void show(){
    Systeem.out.println("in show C");
}
}

public class Demo{
    public static void main(String []args){
        A obj =new A();  
        obj.show();  //Output: in show A

        obj =new B(); //reference is A (we can use reference of parents) and create object of B  and assign to parents reference variable.
        obj.show();  //Output: in show B

        obj =new B();  //reference is A (we can use reference of parents) and create object of C and assign to parents reference variable.
        obj.show();  //Output: in show C

 
    }
}

Note: during compile time we donot which show() method is called from which class.
    -- we can know during run time which show method is called this is known as run time polymorphism.
    -- all this concept is class dynamic method dispatch
