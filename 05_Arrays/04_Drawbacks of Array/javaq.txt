The very first draw back of array is that array is of fixed size and suppose in future you need to
increase the size of the array you cant do that.
Like there is a solution that you can create a new array of bigger length but the thing is that it will
consume lot of time and also space.

Further like if you need to find the element in the array you need to traverse through the array, no doubt 
we have some algorithms to help us but still the thing is that it take time and also strong foundations.

Array is good and have its own benefits ofcourse but we are talking about drawbacks because there must 
be something that cover these drawbacks of the array, that are known as collections, we will discuss 
about them later.
