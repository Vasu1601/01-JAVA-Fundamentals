In Java, collection consists of:
1. Collection API  -- concept
2. Collection  -- Interface
3. Collections -- Class

- A framework is a set of classes and interfaces which provide a ready-made architecture.
- Any group of individual objects which are represented as a single unit is known as the collection of the objects.
- Collection is used to store multiple values.
- Array is also used to store multiple values but it is not used in dynamic programming.
- We use data structures to store and fetch the data.
- Collection API is used in the java 1.2 version where you can work with all data structures by using some in-built classes.

- We can use an array, where the length will be fixed. We cannot expand the size of an array.
- Wherever we have a specific requirement for different algorithms and structures, we can use collection API.
