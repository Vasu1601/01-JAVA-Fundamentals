Polymorphism - 
-- it is important concept of object oriented programming.
-- one word in poly which means  many and words morphism means behaviour.
-- the polymorphism means behaving one action differently in different situation in java. 

-- two types of polymorphism 
-- compile time polymorphism and Run time polymorphism
-- when you compile the file and you will know what things get executed this behaviour is knows as compile time polymorphism.
-- when behaviour decide at run time this is known as run time polymorphism.
-- add(int, int) , add(int, int, int) decided at compile time

- class A extends B  -- A class  has add(int, int) and B has add(int,int ) out of this two we can decide which can execute at run time then this is called run time polymorphism example.
